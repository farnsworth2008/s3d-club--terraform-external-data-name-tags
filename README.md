## Overview
This module provides a way to produce randomized names that follow a style we
find is useful.

Our names are a mix of informative informative and random information.

Injecting random information into names helps us avoid collision when we are
establishing new resources that replace existing onces. Most of the names in
our configurations use this module. Unless a strong reason exist to avoid
random names we recommend using this module.
